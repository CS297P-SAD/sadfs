### Sprint Retrospective:
This section should answer the following questions:
* What did you do this sprint?  
    We spent the first week finalizing our idea. The second week we continued  
    to read up on potential distributed file system architectures while we  
    designed our own. We also set up a git repo and the basic client and  
    server programs.
* What went well?

* What should go better?
