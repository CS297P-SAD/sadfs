### Sprint Retrospective:
* What did you do this sprint?

  We spent the first week finalizing our idea. The second week we continued to read up on potential distributed file system architectures while we designed our own. We also set up a git repo and the basic client and server programs

* What went well?

  We discovered that working virtually the most effecive way to brainstorm was to come up with ideas offline and combine the best aspects of our ideas on our next Zoom call. In person these would likely be whiteboard sessions but for a variety of reasons brainstorming live over Zoom is less effective than this method.
  
* What didnâ€™t go well?

  As mentioned in our short report, consulting entire textbooks on distributed systems is too time consuming for a capstone project. We found much more utility in looking at white papers or other documents describing the design choices of other file systems.

* What should go better?

  We haven't made much progress on the actual coding side yet. This is probably okay as we got a lot of preliminary design work done but this next sprint will hopefully have more tangible results.
