### Sprint Retrospective:
This section should answer the following questions:
* **What did you do this sprint?**  
  We implemented the following:
  - a SQLite3-based database to persist information on the master server,
  and read it back into memory upon start-up.
  - (de)serialization of data using Google's Protocol Buffers instead of
  rolling our own.
  - runtime bookkeeping functionalities that will help in serving requests.
  - foundations of FUSE support (pending review).
  - foundations of a control message passing framework involving wrappers
  around Protocol Buffers, which we decided to redesign (in progress).
  - we decided to use the gRPC framework to stream file data between clients
  and chunk servers, and are working on its implementation (in progress).

* **What went well?**  
  We started working on the core functionality and have made considerable
  progress, after spending the last few sprints on setting up supporting
  functionalities. FUSE support from the get go is a huge bonus, and will
  make the file system much simpler to set up and use. The build automation
  and sanity checks we introduced on GitHub saved us a big headache later on
  by catching compatibility issues early on. The re-implemented control 
  message framework will make adding further control messages easy and less
  error-prone.

* **What didnâ€™t go well?**  
  According to the road map we came up with, we should have progressed further
  than we did. Spending more time on designing the control message framework
  would have saved us a few days' effort that went into the re-implementation.
  In terms of planning, adding a single user story for the implementation of
  control messages was short-sighted. Our code review process is slower than
  we want it to be.

* **What should go better?**
  Our velocity needs to improve, and we should figure out a way to get pull
  requests through the door at a much quicker pace.
