## Week 7 - Small report #4

### Team: GLADFS - Shubham Gupta, Adam Monahan, Daman Mohan Kumar

1. What we did as a team during the week that just ended (later on this can become "which user stories"). Which team member worked on which parts?
	
  Shubham worked on user stories related to fuse support and the client daemon. Daman worked on protobufs and the messaging protocol. Adam worked on the setting up the database. We also held a longer meeting Thursday to outline the remaining work to be done and come up with a rough schedule of when everthing should be completed.
 
2. What worked and what didn't work during the week. For items or tasks that didn't work, why did they not work?
	
 The automatic build tests we set up allowed us to catch issues with compiling on other platforms before merging, likely saving us a lot of headache later on. 
 
3. What do we plan to work on next week? This chapter #3 can be affected by chapters #1 and #2 above.

  We plan to have the control messaging finished next week. We will also continue working on setting up tables stored on the servers to support basic read/write operations.
